Code I'm writing while reading Cracking the Coding Interview (CtCi). 

The LinkedList, Queue, Binary Tree, and Min-heap are completely original. (CtCi provides no code whatsoever for min-heap just a brief conceptual overview, and like 10 lines of very rudimentary code in java for linked lists.)

Stacks are easy to implement with python lists.

The Min-heap and Que use the LinkedList.
